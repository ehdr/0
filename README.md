# 0
A trivial fork of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/), which in turn is "a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone)".

For more, see the [README.md](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/blob/master/README.md) file from the main 2048 GitHub project.

Just like 2048, this was made just for fun. [Play it at erichansander.com/p/0/!](http://erichansander.com/p/0/)
